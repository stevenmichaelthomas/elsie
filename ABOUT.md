## What is Elsie? ##

Elsie is a mobile app designed and developed for people who frequent the LCBO, the alcohol authority in Ontario, Canada. The crown-owned corporation is "one of the world's largest single purchasers of alcoholic beverage products" - having sold over $1 billion in alcohol over the 2014 winter holiday alone. 

## What can Elsie do? ##
* Search for products across all LCBOs or individual stores
* Save your favourite products for quick access any time
* Remember your recently searched products
* Suggest similar products relative to a product you've searched
* Provide location-based listings of nearby stores, including hours, maps, and contact info

This list is growing - Elsie gets a new ability every month.

## Why would I want it? ##
Unfortunately, rapid access to current LCBO data isn't easy. That's why [Carsten Nielsen](http://heycarsten.com) created the [LCBO API](http://lcboapi.com) back in 2009. It's an actively developed project which still runs strong today, and it's the dataset that powers everything Elsie does.

## So Elsie is a frontend to the LCBO API? ##
Exactly. Thanks Carsten!
